📦 Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes supply chain operations to uncover delivery delays, logistics inefficiencies, regional risks, and product profitability patterns.
The goal is to transform raw operational data into actionable insights that support better logistics planning and business decision-making.

🚨 Business Problem

Logistics operations face inconsistent delivery performance, impacting customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Identifying delay drivers and profitability trade-offs is critical for improving service reliability while maintaining business margins.


🎯 Business Questions Answered

Are deliveries happening on time?

Which shipping modes are causing delays?

Which countries have logistics risk?

How is order demand trending over time?

Which product categories are profitable or operationally challenging?

🔍 Operational & Customer Behavior Insights

Second Class shipping shows the highest delay rates but continues to generate strong order volume and solid profit per order. This indicates a trade-off between delivery reliability and business profitability.

Although delays are frequent, the average delay is relatively small (around 1–2 days). This suggests the delivery experience may be inconvenient but not severe enough to significantly reduce demand.

First Class shipping carries higher customer expectations, meaning even small delays in this mode may impact customer satisfaction more strongly than in economy shipping options.

The dataset does not include shipping cost or customer preference information. Therefore, while continued usage of slower shipping options suggests customers may accept longer delivery times, this remains a behavioral hypothesis rather than a confirmed conclusion.

From an operational perspective, improving reliability—especially for Second Class shipping—represents a major opportunity to enhance customer trust while maintaining profitability.
